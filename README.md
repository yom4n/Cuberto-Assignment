# Cuberto Assginment

## Section I chose
I chose the top sectiom of the landing page where in I implemented:
1. Animation on the main quote or motto when the page renders.
2. Animation on the company LGGO and MENU icon when the page renders.
3. Tracking the mouse pointer with delayed animation.
4. Masking the bigger video when the page renders

## Tech I used
1. Javascript
2. ReactJS
3. Framer motion library for animations
4. CSS for styling

## Challenges I faced
1. Initially I was unable animate each word/letter on the motto/logo respectively but after thinking about it a bit I decided to map each word/letter and contain each item in a div which allowed me to animate individually and with a delay as well.
